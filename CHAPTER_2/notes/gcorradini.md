Basic Data Structures
============================

Stacks::
    - example of how function calls are stacks inherently
    - show how stacks can be swapped for recursiveness
    - show how stacks can be used with pure Python data types
    - depth first algorthm and different ways to understand it


Queue and Printing Tasks::
    - example of how queues can be used for passing multiprocesses messages
    - job queue example ( Celery and RabbitMQ )
    - show multiprocessed job queue for timeit functionality
    - breadth first algorthm and different ways to understand it


Balanced Symbols and Prefix, Postfix and Infix::
    - example of how this can be used as a parser ( HTML, YAML )
    - can this be used in creating AST or parsing it ?

Unordered and Ordered Lists and Node Generation::
    - examples of this in C would be helpful to think about
    - review how crucial the idea of creating Nodes are in C
    - show example of dot-notaion accessibility extending Python basic data types
